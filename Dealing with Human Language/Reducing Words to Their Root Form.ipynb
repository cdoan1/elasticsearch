    "### Reducing Words to Their Root Form\n",
    "\n",
    "Most languages of the world are inflected, meaning that words can change their form to express differences in the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Number: fox, foxes\n",
    "* Tense: pay, paid, paying\n",
    "* Gender: waiter, waitress\n",
    "* Person: hear, hears\n",
    "* Case: I, me, my\n",
    "* Aspect: ate, eaten\n",
    "* Mood: so be it, were it so\n",
    "\n",
    "While inflection aids expressivity, it interferes with retrievability, as a single root word sense (or meaning) may be represented by many different sequences of letters\n",
    "\n",
    "Stemming attempts to remove the differences between inflected forms of a word, in order to reduce each word to its root form. For instance foxes may be reduced to the root fox.\n",
    "\n",
    "If stemming were easy, there would be only one implementation. Unfortunately, stemming is an inexact science that suffers from two issues: understemming and overstemming.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The root form of a word may not even be a real word**. The words ```jumping``` and ```jumpiness``` may both be stemmed to ```jumpi```. It doesn’t matter—as long as the same terms are produced at index time and at search time, search will just work.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understemming is the failure to reduce words with the same meaning to the same root. For example, ```jumped``` and ```jumps``` may be reduced to ```jump```, while ```jumping``` may be reduced to ```jumpi```. **Understemming reduces retrieval**; relevant documents are not returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overstemming is the failure to keep two words with distinct meanings separate. For instance, ```general``` and ```generate``` may both be stemmed to ```gener```. **Overstemming reduces precision**: irrelevant documents are returned when they shouldn’t be.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Lemmatization ####\n",
    "\n",
    "A lemma is the canonical, or dictionary, form of a set of related words—the lemma of paying, paid, and pays is pay. Sometimes the morphology differs: is, was, am, and being is be.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lemmatization, like stemming, tries to group related words, but it goes one step further than stemming in that it tries to group words by their word sense, or meaning. The same word may represent two meanings—for example,wake can mean to wake up or a funeral. While lemmatization would try to distinguish these two word senses, stemming would incorrectly conflate them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lemmatization is a much more complicated and expensive process that needs to understand the context in which words appear in order to make decisions about what they mean. In practice, stemming appears to be just as effective as lemmatization, but with a much lower cost."
