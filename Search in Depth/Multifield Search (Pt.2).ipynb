But what if we have another person in the index whose name is Smith Williams? Smith as a first name is very uncommon and so will have a high IDF!\n",

    "These problems only exist because we are dealing with multiple fields. If we were to combine all of these fields into a single field, the problems would vanish. We could achieve this by adding a full_name field to our person document:\n",

    "* Documents with more matching words would trump documents with the same word repeated.\n",

    "* The inverse document frequencies for first and last names would be combined so it wouldn’t matter whether Smith were a first or last name anymore.\n",
    "\n",
    "While this would work, we don’t like having to store redundant data. Instead, Elasticsearch offers us two solutions—one at index time and one at search time:\n",

    "\n",
    "The [Metadata: _all Field](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/guide/master/root-object.html#all-field) stored all values from all fields as one big string. A more flexible approach is an `_all` field for the person’s name, and another custom `_all` field for the address. \n",
